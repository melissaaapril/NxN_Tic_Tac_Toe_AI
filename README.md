This is a test phase of the project.

Current build of as OCT 15 is a stable version, with few game logic errors that need to be fixed. Professor will give us extra time to complete the project.

So far I wish to implement (as per professors suggestion):
1. Human vs Human.
2. More than 2 players with different symbols.
3. Multithreading capabilities for efficiency.

I will upload the code, keep in mind the code will not run. This is because the code cannot be compiled without the necessary files/dependencies. 

To combat this, I will be using pyinstaller, and compressing them into executable files (.exe) for rapid testing.

It is never recommended to open untrusted .exe files, so the sake of cyber hygeine and proper internet ettiquete, you should use a virtual machine.
